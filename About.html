    <p> I'm Ashwin. I'm a Finance Transformation Manager living in Poland.
    <br></br>

  At HP Inc. my responsibility is that of a product manager leading a virtual team of product owners. Our team works with software developers to build solutions for supply chain optimization, business intelligence capabilities, statutory compliance needs and process automation.

        <h3>Day at work:</h3>
        <br></br>
        I spend most time arbitrating business needs with available IT resources to keep projects moving at a fast pace and within boundaries of overall solution architecture.
        <br></br>
        Expertise of Business Process and IT Solution is how I sift lists of asks from business groups to discover high priority needs and to simplify them adequately so their IT solutions become feasible. Negotiation and influence is par for course on daily basis.
        <br></br>
        The excitement in my day is owed for the need to get up to speed quickly on a variety of business issues and articulate why a calculated risk is needed to avoid standing still on  a program. A clear and unambiguous choice is a rarity.
        <br></br>
        <h3>Day outside work:</h3>
        <br></br>
        In the context of my work, I stay up to date on a variety of topics about technology, business trends and decision science. This has, over a decade, induced a general curiosity in me about how technology influences economy, culture and life itself.
        <br></br>
        My biggest influences though are still classics like "Human Nature" by E.O. Wilson, "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman, "The Modern Firm" by John Roberts and all articles and poetries by Charles Simic.
