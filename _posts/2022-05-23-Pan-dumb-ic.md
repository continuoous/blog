description: Nothing about what transpired in the pandemic should surprise us
summary: Our reaction to a life-threatening pandemic was fight or flight. In fact, we did one up with fight AND flight in that we fought all public healthcare measures and then took flight to crowded bars, resorts, and concerts. Turned out, it was a questionable reaction.

**Second fiddle to a rock**
 
After and since Armageddon (1998), Bruce Willis has become the only A-list action star to save earth from an asteroid. Yes – its generous praise what with Paris entirely obliterated at the end. But we can agree he did well because decimating an asteroid, the size of Texas, is no laughing matter. 
 
Yes. Texas. Evidently, scientific accuracy wasn’t on top, or anywhere in the vicinity, of the writer’s mind. So, limiting annihilation to a single metropolis and a few meteorites disturbing NYC's furniture, in my opinion, counts for humanity slash planet saving accomplishment. But that is clearly not my point.
 
The point is also not how unlikely it is that an A-lister will, anytime in near future, take on sizable space rocks hurtling toward us. Do you ask why? Well, disaster movies demand said hurtling objects pummel earth as hard as they can. If you are wishing the brave protagonist safely would nudge that comet away to prevent hundred feet tsunami waves and obliteration of half a dozen global landmarks, then, trust me buddy, you are alone rooting for that outcome. They are called disaster movies for a reason.
 
And, with CGI getting better and cheaper - there's no reason an A-lister will play second fiddle to a rock (Note: *a* rock not *The* Rock).

**Don’t look up a Christmas miracle**
 
That said, we witnessed something of a Christmas miracle in 2021 with a disaster movie starring not one but, if my count is right, five academy awards winning actors - "Don't look up" (2021).
 
In a nutshell, stupidity causing human extinction is this excellent dark comedy’s premise. It alludes to corporate greed, inept leaders, misinformation, and in general, idiots running the world as reasons we perish at the end - which are all depressingly plausible. Again, not my central point though.
 
For a disaster movie, you might imagine, as I did, an edge of seat thriller about if and how we will eventually survive an impending disaster. The writers however appear to have abandoned all hope to begin from a different chilling question. They asked themselves not if, but why we will perish when a comet heads our way.
 
Admittedly, not much at stake in a silly fiction. Notwithstanding the fact that a 10-mile radius object will, depending on it’s make and model,  do just fine killing us all - I find this scenario uninteresting because whether we survive a comet hardly depends on you and I. 

If we don't survive, tough luck. If we do, I’ll be overwhelmed by gratitude for living at the same time as geniuses who can destroy comets. You might feel the same way or feel an urge to post YouTube videos titled "We never should’ve have blown up that comet because now we’ll never know if it was real or wait, did we actually blow it up or was it… hmm".

**A fun, not at all anxiety inducing, thought experiment**
 
Allow me to now point something totally random completely out of nowhere. If a hostage threatened with a loaded gun pointed at his head goes "Well, what's you pulling that trigger got anything to do with me dying?", then it's fair to assume his time has come. I'll soon clarify why I felt the need to point this out.
 
With all that said and out of our way. Here's a fun, not at all anxiety inducing, thought experiment that I'd really like to pick your brain on. Instead of a comet, if we faced a deadlier pandemic, which is the more relevant question? Is it – “whether and how we will survive such extinction level threat?” or is it for example, “why our species is doomed to extinction?”
 
Let's all try and stay calm here as we proceed to talk about that.
 
If you feel a strong urge, as some might, to react with "Nah, I don't buy it. That whole covid thing. Not real. It was a deep state and slash or Chinese hoax", then I'd like to end here with my earlier anecdote about the hostage who had a gun pointed to his head. 

Truly admire you sticking with me because according to research only 1 in 300 people make it this far. But I suspect, whatever follows is not going to resonate all that well for you.
 
For the rest, a quick disclaimer: Look, not that it matters, but I'm not an epidemiologist, virologist, or whichever x-gist is an authority on pandemic related topics. So, take everything written here with like a barrel of salt. As I'm sure you will.

**Bad behaviour in a pandemic**
 
Unless you've been living inside a cave under a mountain in an ocean on a planet outside solar system, it should be obvious that a pandemic with a sufficiently high R-naught and mortality rate will kill us all. You might naturally ask if such a pandemic isn’t just science fiction? I don’t know. But.
 
Measles' R-naught is ten. Meaning every infected person infects ten others. Ebola's mortality can be ninety percent. Meaning nine out of ten Ebola patients can die. A virus as infectious as measles and as dangerous as Ebola is what we are talking about. Cant Measles like virus mutate into Ebola like virus? I hope not. But hoping not doesn’t make it science fiction.
 
I don't know how likely such a pandemic might come to pass and that's fine because the question isn't if such pandemic will emerge, it is why we won't survive if it emerges?

**Fight and Flight**
 
It may not come as a surprise to ardent evolutionary theory fans that after millions of years of evolution, our first reaction when we faced a life-threatening pandemic was fight or flight. In fact, we did one up with fight AND flight in that we fought for “freedom” from every common-sense public healthcare measure like our lives depended on it, and then took flight to crowded bars, resorts, and concerts. It turned out to be a questionable approach after all.
 
Whether we survive a deadlier pandemic can be forbade, I think, depending on whether our bad behaviour this time around was surprising, meaning – there’s a chance we’ll behave better, or entirely expected all along, meaning – well, extinction.

I want to make a case that in hindsight, our behaviour was not a surprise in the slightest because listen, our **institutional trust** issues is as deep as our need to be smart asses about everything.

**Mild trust issues**
 
We don't trust anybody. Not doctors, politicians, corporates, NGOs, News outlets, Uncles, Aunts, Dogs, Cats. Nobody. You might ask “Yeah, so what? What does that have anything to do with surviving pandemics?” and then you might ask “And, by the way, is it really our fault that we trust nobody?”
 
Got it. Lets explore that first question with a totally made up hypothetical situation.
 
In this situation, you are a totally rational person keenly aware of your shortcoming of not being an epidemiologist or virologist. But, lets assume you’ve got trust issues. 
 
You do your best making sense of peer reviewed scientific papers about vaccine safety and cant make up your mind if you must line up for that first shot. So, as any rational person would, you decide to consider getting your shot after the first million doses. Surely, by then vaccines safety will be a settled matter. News sources you follow are all credible.
 
A million doses pinched and just so happens that after their shot, three peoples’ heart went lub dub dub lub, dub dub instead of lub dub lub dub lub dub lub dub and so on. Doctors reassure the public “Look, these vaccines are safe. Far safer than not getting one at all. And about that heart – its just a temporary thing. It’ll get back to singing lub dub lub dub or whatever beat you prefer in a couple of weeks, don’t worry. Its safe”. 

But trust issues man. You are not sure. So you are thinking “I’ll wait another million doses just so I know this problem isn’t any worse”. You follow only the best, reputable news sources.
 
Million more doses administered and good news. Sure enough, only three more cases. OK – lets get to the vaccination centre. But wait, one of your closest virile (not viral) friends sends you an obscure article about how vaccines make you impotent. He’s looking out for you. But you are a smart guy – right? Surely, you see from a mile away your buddy is getting anxious about this conspiratorial nonsense. 

You continue driving to the vaccination centre anyway. Your Virile friend calls you. He says “Dude, did you read that article. Surely, its conspiracy nonsense. Right? But what if its not. May be we wait a couple more million shots. Did you read about Djokovic? Surely he knows something about vaccines and Virility.”
 
You are now mildly freaking out. We are not talking about life and death. This is impotency man. Imagine just how stupid you’d feel if you know – after the vaccine, things head south. OK, you need more time to make up your mind. U-turn it is for now.
 
On the way back, a brilliant idea occurs. You are so surprised it didn’t occur to you already. “Millions and Millions of people are getting their shots meaning – wait, herd immunity! So odds of my infection are plummeting. Why bother with these shots? Also, the vaccines don’t prevent infection entirely – they are only 99.5% effective. So, I have a window of an opportunity here to free ride the entire pandemic! Why didn’t I think about it earlier? So stupid”
 
Yeah. Well. Only two problems with this entirely rational strategy
 
* One, As you play, if you catch the hypothetical Measles Ebola variant. You are dead.
* Two, As you play, if everybody self-strategizes just as you did. We are ALL dead.
 
Now admittedly, this is a hypothetical situation and you the reader would never ever be so lame as to not get your vaccines on time. But there is a technical term for this kind of strategy - its “Prisoner’s Dilemma”. 

And what can save us from “you are dead” or “we are all dead” scenarios is resolving Institutional trust issues man. It's how we’ll survive a deadly pandemic. And that’s why institutional trust issues matter to surviving pandemics.
 
That said, Let's move on to the next question which naturally follows - “will we trust institutions - Ever?”. Why is our trust in institutions so irreparably damaged in the first place? It sounds complicated, but it's not.

**Here’s a 12 point history lesson for how we got here.**

1.	Our relationship with news began a long time ago. At the very beginning, you’d hear “Look, there’s a tiger in the cave”. Then you were dead. “Look the Mongols are in our village”. You were dead. “Look, Volcano”. Dead. This went on for a long time in human history, I assume.
2.	Then priests became news casters, kind of. News such as "She's a witch, burn her". "Well, we thought she was a witch until she drowned". “There’s a new trend people are catching on to – called Plague”. In a sense, this was all generally, local news variety.
3.	All this hearsay and gossip was replaced with written word when Gutenberg invented printing press which turned out great for decrees about how much tax you had to pay to keep your head over your shoulder. Basically, royalty had a monopoly over "news" publication.
4.	Next, Radio and television came along and made news a whole lot less complicated. Aspiring news junkies didn’t so much as need to graduate from high school because news consumption was now passive. It had become entertainment.
5.	Seeing that people find news amusing and because whatever is amusing sells ads, media executives came to the most obvious conclusion any online MBA graduate would arrive at. Tell more news. News minute gave way to an hour of news. Then, that hour was repeated a couple of times a day and eventually somebody concluded "you know what, screw it, let's do this 24 hours a day".
6.	Soon enough, these executives hit upon a, not so unexpected, problem. There's only so much happening in the world. So, instead of talking about facts, the geniuses filled time with opinions of experts, politicians, professors, cooks, crooks, dancers, dandelions and clowns. All comers welcome.
7.	Then of course, as luck would have it – the social network was invented. Now every infant in Rome, Romania or Rhode Island with access to Wiki pages or twitter suddenly became a broadcaster because every opinion with or without evidence, according to us, is equally valid. That’s how much we care for truth.
8.	Flashback to 40s, something important had occurred with the whole passive news consumption (point 4 above) and it had a very bad outcome. Fascists took over Europe using radio "news" as a tool of propaganda. Then the free world defeated Fascists. Good. But western democracies took an important lesson to heart, from Nazis none the less, that humans are super gullible and will eventually believe any lie if it is repeated often enough.
9.	Flash forward to 2020. Imagine, you are politician. You don’t have a bloody clue how the pandemic will transpire for a simple reason that you are not in possessions of, what in popular folklore is called, a crystal ball. Yet your constituents are freaked out, have no patience for your lame predictions and, more importantly, no tolerance for lockdowns. They want unimpeachable prophecies. What do you do? Your years of political experience hasn’t taught you to be a Epidemiologist, it made you a master of spin. So you put that skill to work, As any sane politician would.
10.	You begin with innocent prophecies like “Don’t worry about this pandemic, please continue your day job at the meat factory”, then you realise things are getting real, so you put a spin on it for few weeks calling it “China Virus”, people are now dying and there’s no vaccine, “Well ok, erythromycin, chloroquine, penicillin” whatever you can think of. No progress, more people dying and you try “You know what, we are so much better than whichever is the country worst hit by this pandemic – stop counting our dead, count theirs’”
11.	Then, the moment of truth. Doctors have had enough. They come out and say “Look, don’t be stupid. Lockdown the economy for a few weeks, maybe months, you know what round it out to an year and by then we’ll workout a vaccine” and your response is? “Don’t trust them – they don’t know what they are talking about” and you repeat it again and again and again until at least 50% of your constituents believe you – the threshold you care about for your next election.
12.	The crazy thing is you know how to do this because you are a master of spin. You can do it over and over and over again without ever paying a price for it. So, why not.

<br>
You can see where this is going. Not where we’d believe experts and institutions. We’d rather question everything or believe only what we want to believe.

Is there a way out of this mess. I don’t know. I wouldn’t bet on anyone who promises they do. 

But it appears the writers of *don’t look up* had good reason to begin with “why our species is doomed to extinction?” and not “whether and how we will survive extinction level threats?”. 

A sobering thought - Life itself feels like an excellent dark comedy.
