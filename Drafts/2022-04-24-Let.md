A **prime number** is divisible only by itself and 1 meaning the remainder of dividing a prime number by any other integer greater than 1 is always greater than 0.

## Algorithm

2.  set $$n = 5,000,000,000,000$$
3.  for all integers $$i$$ between $$2$$ and $$âˆšn$$, if remainder of any $$n/i$$ is greater than $$0$$
  -  then show n as result 
  -  else set $$n = n + 1$$ and goto step 2.

Now over to spreadsheet.
