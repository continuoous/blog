Meme stocks on the face of it appear fascinating. GameStop, AMC, etc. But, atleast the modus-operandi is clear. Identify a stock with massive short positions. Spread word of mouth to have enough investors buy and hold the stock forcing the hand of large investors to buy the stock at high prices. Social media has not only made this sequence of event plausible, but also possible. So, its fascinating to see how such risky stock purchases can be coordinated at such massive scale - but what's happening here isn't entirely a mystery. Crypto currency is an entirely different story. There are many fascinating stories here - the many ways of pump and dump schemes, the ways of raising capital yet avoid scrutiny that comes with raising capital in fiscal currencies, the ease of creating several crypto currencies etc.

Lets hone in on Bitcoin - certainly the most well known currency with the largest market cap.

Lets grant for a moment that everything that is said about BitCoin is true. Its certainly plausible - its as if a new mineral was discovered that is not only as rare and durable as gold - but also with tha added advantage... we might truly be living through a monumentally historic moment. Bitcoin might very well become the defacto currency of the world. But, then why is it so volatile? unlike the current defacto currency or for that matter gold.

A witness is considered reliable if he stays true to his oath that he'll speak the truth, only the truth and the whole truth.

I suspect that he has any extra-ordinary power over the flow of billions of dollars... imagine a scenario that Tim Cook announced that someday in future he foresees that customers could buy iphones with some form of crypto currency. Maybe even Bitcoin. What such a tweet might do to its price is a rhetorical question.

El-Salvador uses US Dollars as its main currency anyway. It also just announced that bitcoin is widely accepted in the country. how might this play out. Or how is it ought to play out.

Bitcoin is not a good, service or an asset that can generate rent. Its a currency - a store of value just like gold, any number of currencies. I hear the argument that art is what it is valued at.. but there is a BIG difference - you need 1 willing marginal buyer in future - not the entire citizenry.

So what is the best case scenario that people are betting on. This bet does matter because it appears to be in the order of hundreds of billions of dollars.

The bet is not about the discovery of a new efficient currency. The speculation is not about a high price discovery. This is a bet that people, massive number of people, will continue to beleive the story that they bought into that Bitcoin will make them riches. That they'll beleive it against all odds, against all logic, against overwhelming evidence. That they wont only beleive in it - but will also do all they can to make it happen. This is a bet on irrational exuberence and if we know anything about species - our irrational exeuberance is a extraordinarily safe bet as long as we are able to hold on it - even with the thinnest sliver of hope.
