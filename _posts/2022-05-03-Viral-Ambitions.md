summary: Talking happens as if it were a game and it creates bubbles instead of knowledge. In such a world, it doesn't matter which billionaire buy which social networking company.

You may have heard about this billionaire who will, maybe soon, buy this huge social networking company for a boat load of money because, you know, free speech. And opinion writers are freaking out what all of this means to, guess what, free speech.

I don't know. Maybe we'll end up with an edit and a dislike button. Maybe this social network becomes wildly NSFW. This billionaire says he'll unlock a lot of value and, well, he's known for it, so - it could become like that other huge social networking behemoth. But then, he also mused he isn't exactly into it to make money ‚Äì so it could also end up like, you know, Myspace? 

We can knock ourselves out all we want, but there‚Äôs no telling how this will all pan out. I frankly don't care. But, it got me thinking about how we talk to each other and it's outright bonkers weird. Lets talk about that.

Imagine you are in an enviable marriage. You love your spouse for the care, support, travels, fist fights or whatever it is that makes your marriage tick. Ten years have passed and you've shared you joys, sorrows, fears, guilt, successes and insecurities. You both have truly become soul mates. What do you think is a weird thing to do when you wake up on your tenth anniversay morning? It is to tell your spouse "darling, I'm so lucky I spent these ten wonderful years with you. Thank you so much my love. You make my life meaningful, wonderful. Etc. etc." ‚Ä¶ on Facebook. While your spouse is still in a deep slumber. Right next to you. And wait for those likes to roll in.

And this isn't uncommon. So much so, you are probably thinking "Wait, nothing wrong professing love online - the world needs to know how much I love my partner" or worse, you are thinking "wait, who is this clown telling me I shouldn't have posted the thing that I did on our anniversary".

I get it. And trust me, I'm not trying to single you out. This is not about you. I was only beginning to make a point about how, in the social networking world, all humans talk funny to each other. So lets get back to think about why our hypothetical, totally based on real life, scenario might not be a weird thing after all.

A common retort goes something like this - "Look, I don‚Äôt know where you come from, but in civilized world - there is such a thing called toast. And these posts are our online toasts. And the likes are our friends raising their online glasses to my tribute. That‚Äôs how we chose to be part of a community. So, nothing unusual here"

But, is it really? Because I don't hear tributes and compliments in market squares or downtown alleys, not least in midst of strangers. And about those likes. Let's be clear, it's not people "raising glasses" because if they wanted to, they'd use an appropriate emoji - ü•Ç. They are offering thumbs up. And, oh boy, it is an ambiguous thumb alright.

Does that üëç mean
<br>
"oh so cute, I'm happy you are in a loving marraige" or <br> 
"yeah, I too like that your spouse is caring and pretty and sexy and you know what, I've said too much" or <br> 
"I can't stand your partner, I like your spouse is not my spouse"?

It's hard to tell because there's no record of why somebody likes a post. There is, in fact, no record of why somebody believes anything on social media.

Admittedly, it's not important here. But, if you like a post about a mad shooting incident, it's useful to know if you liked that there were no victims or that the shooter was killed in an ensuing gruesome shootout or that the person who posted this is hiring right now or you liked because you think your contacts are likely to post many comments. 

It's important because, the lack of why, the context, is how we create - and pay close attention because I'm introducing an important and useful technical term here - information bubbles.

This is bonkers weird. The whole point of conversations is to exchange thoughts, understand and be understood. Yet, in online conversations, we end up in hearing tunnels because, ironically, we don't care enough to think through, express or understand why we believe and why we say something, anything.

Here's another argument about why our original hypothetical scenario might not be weird. It could go like - "Look man, speak for yourself, not everybody is fishing likes. I happen to post what's on my mind. Think of It as a record of special life occasions and if people also happen to like it, no harm".

Ok, I see the point. A record of occasions - birthdays, anniversaries, career milestones and so on. Let's ignore, for a moment, that talking in person, a phone call, a video chat, a private instant message, an email and a hand written letter were all skipped before choosing an online public notice board to record the wish and make the occasion special. Instead, let's ask if these posts can in any way make the special occasion less special?

I can think of one scenario. Posting a wish and not getting likes. I'll take the liberty to state this as an axiom - it's, at the very least, awkward if you post about how you've loved every minute of your decade long marraige and nobody cares to like your post. So why risk it? Why post this and risk making the special occasion, at the very least, awkward for yourself and, maybe also for your spouse.

I'd believe someone who says "I couldn't care less about whether people like my posts" if they also posted other things "on their mind" which just so happen to be unlikable. E.g. a post about how they wish something terrible happened to their spouse's annoying parent or why they think their partner doesn't nearly deserve that bonus as much as they do. Until I see such posts, which as you can imagine - I have not, I'll justifiably hold on to my belief that people don't post things "on their mind" with disregard for whether it is liked.

Meanwhile, let's not lose sight of a deeper question here. True as that supposed axiom might be, the more important question is why is it true. Why does it matter to us how many people punch that like icon. Its because our conversations are, and here's another important and useful technical term for you - Gamified.

Conversations aren't anymore about expressing thoughts and understanding and being understood. It sure as heck is NOT about building connections. It's about metrics. You can measure and compare your thought beginning with your hangover, breakfast, afternoon traffic, today's sunset, that politician you hate, the song you love, your best friends wedding anniversary or about that billionaire who's buying that social networking company.

As a pleasurable activity, thoughts are redundant if not immediately published for instantaneous reactions, adulations and, you know, engagement.

Finally, an argument about why wishing a spouse on Facebook for an anniversary might not be weird could go something like - You are a sociopath, go live in a cave if you wish to. People aren't going back to days before social networks because we love to share thoughts and knowledge. We are all much better off for the knowledge shared - infact, everything I know about artificial intelligence is from my network of AI geeks. A smart billionaire said AI is a much bigger risk to humanity than nuclear weapons - how'd i know that without social network. Don't forget arabspring, metoo, wallstreetbets and many other revolutions.

Now, if this argument resonates for you, Congratulations for ignoring entirely the fact that I only set out to lay an argument about how we talk weird and not about whether social networks are useful. But, in a narrow sense - let's talk about whether our online knowledge sharing conversations aren't unusual. Social networks could be useful tools sharing knowledge - like your schools' math club. Right?

Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a social network exists which has eliminated harassment, bullying, conspiracy theories and all forms of harmful content. We have a network of people gathered only for the benevolent purpose of sharing knowledge. Now if we received all notes from our network contacts about all the knowledge they want to share in a nice chronologically sorted list of posts and messages, then we'd really be talking about an group email forum. Social networks don't work like this.

Here's a handy ten step guide for how an entirely benevolent social network would work.

1. You are interested to chat and share knowledge about, let's say, linear algebra. So you connect with ten linear algebra loving geeks.

2. They each send you a couple of messages each day. You thank them for sharing their knowledge. Others like that you thanked them. Few others like that other liked that you thanked them.

3. You are all becoming better linear algebra experts - twenty nuggets of knowledge each day. Life is good.

4. Then your ten contacts come upon a brilliant but unexpected idea. They make friends with ten other linear algebra enthusiasts, each, who you've never met online or in real life.

5. You are now connected to a hundred more linear algebra geeks because you see your ten contacts liking and thanking their friends for the articles shared.

6. You've hit a tiny problem. You begin seeing two hundred nuggets of knowledge everyday in your feed. Now, you love linear algebra more than anything in life - but, even you begin to suspect that surfing two hundred tidbits about linear algebra everyday is no way to live a meaningful life.

7. To make matters worse, those hundred friends of your original ten contacts have discovered they can each make ten connections on their own!

8. Surely this madness must stop. Which nuggets should I really delve into and which must I ignore. And I thought we'd agreed to only take about linear algebra - why does my feed have an article about leaning tower of Pisa?

9. Enter, Social Network alchemists. They know how to weed out the spam. Based on your age, sex, location, your likes, comments, subscriptions, shampoo you bought and color of your eyes - the social network identifies other people, more accurately called users, who share those same traits, more accurately called features, and sort articles they liked for you. The hypothesis being - "dude, listen - you are not all that unique. Trust us, we know."

10. Just so happens people in your age group living close to you aren't as enthusiastic about linear algebra  as they are about crypto currency. You don't understand a word of "knowledge" shared with you. But, you could be losing out on million dollar if you don't follow your networks advice. Wait, what? I came here for the love of Linear algebra. This is fucking chaos!


The point being, social networks are an awfully inefficient way to improve knowledge compared to good old search engine. Ironically, they are a colossal tool to disseminate information - but nearly useless as a learning aid. So, what's the allure of Reddit or EconTwit as bastions of knowledge?

Well, fake signaling devices. All you need to enhance your climate concern profile is to "share" ten articles about the future of geothermal power and "like" ten other articles about how crypto servers burn more fuel than Denmark.

What else? There's entertainment of course. We infinitely scroll through "knowledge" to fuel that dopamine high in anticipation of discovering an article as enlightening as the one we scrolled upon three years back. Learning followed by learning followed by more learning is, let's be frank, entertainment.

It's bonkers weird that our conversations in groups are anything but exchange of ideas and thoughts. They are voyeur expeditions about who's mindlessly liking what and what's receiving attention rather than about what I want to or need to learn.

And that, ladies and gentlement, is why I'm not bothered that a billionaire will, maybe soon, buy this huge social networking company for a boat load of money because, you know, free speech. Because when it comes to speech, forget about "free". We've got bigger problems. How we talk is outright bonkers weird.
