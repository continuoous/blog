          <p>Hi, I'm a Finance Transformation Manager living in Poland. <h4>But I prefer if you'd call me Ashwin.</h4><br></br></p>
        
          <p>My responsibility is that of a product manager leading a team of product owners. <h4>Congrats! You've earned a chance to roll your eyes twice.</h4><br></br></p>
          
          <p>Our team works with software developers. <h4>Wait, that's easy to follow.</h4>
          
          We build solutions for supply chain optimization, business intelligence capabilities, statutory compliance needs and process automation. <h4> Ah! See.. I lost you there again.</h4><br></br></p>
        <br></br>       
          HERE'S WHAT MY DAY LOOKS LIKE AT WORK:
        <br></br>
          I mostly spend time sorting an evergrowing list of business needs to optimize IT resources to keep projects advancing at fast pace. <h4> So proud that I didn't mention "Backlog" or "funnel". But, had to throw in "optimize" to sound savvy.</h4>
        <br></br>
          Expertise of Business Process and IT Solution is how I prioritize business requirements and  simplify them adequately so their IT solutions become feasible. <h4>Negotiation and influence is, everyday, par for the course and is mostly why I still have a job.</h4>
        <br></br>
          My days are exhilarating for the need to get up to speed quickly on a new business issues and articulate why calculated risks are called for to avoid stalling on progress. <h4>Seriously though, clear, unambiguous choices are a rarity. Decision making under uncertainty is my art </h4>
        <br></br>
          DAY OUTSIDE WORK:
        <br></br>
          In the context of my work, I stay up to date on a variety of topics about technology, business trends and decision science. <h4>Of which, I tend to share a post each day on my linkedIn page</h4>
        <br></br>  
          This has, over a decade, induced a general curiosity in me about how technology influences economy, culture and life itself. <h4>Tech and coding, however, isn't my passion per se. I hope they never will.</h4>
        <br></br>
          My bigger influences are classics like "Human Nature" by E.O. Wilson, "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman, "The Modern Firm" by John Roberts and any and all essays and poetry by Charles Simic.
          <h4>About each of which, I intend to write long posts here</h4>
          <br></br>
          THERE IS MORE:
        <br></br>
          I love. I indulge in indolence. I have an opinion about mankind.
          <h4>But this page will suffice to provide context to my writing in continuoous</h4>
