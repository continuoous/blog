description: How to compose readable excel formulas
summary: Nested Excel functions are cryptic and hard to read. LET function un-nests such formulas to makes them intuitive and easier to read.

1.  Excel formulas are hard to read. Case in point, the formula below evaluates if value in *A1* is a prime number. **LET** function can re-compose it to an intuative form.<br>
    ```=(MIN(MOD(A1,SEQUENCE(SQRT(A1),,2,1)))<>0)```


2. Three points before we begin. First, **Prime number** is an integer greater than one which is only divisible by itself and $$1$$. Put another way, the remainder of dividing a prime number by any integer other other than $$1$$ never equals $$0$$.

3. Next, **LET** function assigns names to calculation results. I'll let the picture explain it best.

4. Finally, **Primality test** is an algorithm to determine if a given number, $$n$$, is prime. If $$n$$ is evenly divisible by any number between $$2$$ and $$\sqrt n$$. then it is non-prime. Else, it is prime.
    
5. Primality test for a number $$n$$ follows below sequence.
- calculate $$\sqrt n$$.
- create an integer array {$$2...\sqrt n$$}
- divide $$n$$ by array {$$2...\sqrt n$$} to create new *array of remainders*
- check if minimum value in the *array of remainders* is $$0$$
- if *No*, then $$n$$ is prime.

 
6. **(MIN( MOD( A1, SEQUENCE( SQRT(A1),,2,1 ) ) )<>0)** implements these steps except that its hard to see how. **LET** function is more intuitive in following the sequence of steps.
```
=LET(
Step0,A1,
Step1,SQRT(Step0),
Step2,SEQUENCE(Step1,,2,1),
Step3,MOD(Step0,Step2),
Step4,MIN(Step3),
Step5,(Step4<>0),
Step5
)
```

7. Here's how to read the formula <br><br>
* `Step0,A1,` 
> **Step0** $$\equiv$$ value in **A1**
* `Step1,SQRT(Step0),` 
> **Step1** $$\equiv$$ square root of **Step0**
* `Step2,SEQUENCE(Step1,,2,1),` 
> **Step2** $$\equiv$$ array of integers from $$2$$ to **Step1** with increment of $$1$$
* `Step3,MOD(Step0,Step2),` 
> **Step3** $$\equiv$$ array of remainders resulting from **Step0**/**Step2**
- `Step4,MIN(Step3),` 
> **Step4** $$\equiv$$ minimum value in **Step3**, i.e. array of remainders
- `Step5,(Step4<>0),` 
> **Step5** $$\equiv$$ check of equality if **Step4 <>** $$0$$
- `Step5` 
> Show **Step5**

8. **LET** function is more legible and improves Excel calculation speed. However, nested formula are easier to compose. The best practice might be to compose nested formulas and then convert those to **LET** functions.
