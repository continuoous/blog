        <br></br>
          I'm Ashwin. I'm a Finance Transformation Manager living in Poland.
        <br></br>
          At HP Inc. my responsibility is that of a product manager leading a virtual team of product owners. 
          Our team works with software developers to build solutions for supply chain optimization, business intelligence capabilities, statutory compliance needs and process automation.
        <br></br>       
          DAY AT WORK:
        <br></br>
          I spend most time optimizing lists of business needs with available IT resources to keep projects advancing at fast pace.
        <br></br>
          Expertise of Business Process and IT Solution is how I prioritize business requirements and  simplify them adequately so their IT solutions become feasible. Negotiation and influence is, everyday, par for the course.
        <br></br>
          The excitement is owed for the need to get up to speed quickly on a variety of business issues and articulate why a calculated risks are needed to avoid standing still on a program. A clear and unambiguous choice is a rarity.
        <br></br>
          DAY OUTSIDE WORK:
        <br></br>
          In the context of my work, I stay up to date on a variety of topics about technology, business trends and decision science. This has, over a decade, induced a general curiosity in me about how technology influences economy, culture and life itself.
        <br></br>
          Still, my biggest influences are still classics like "Human Nature" by E.O. Wilson, "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman, "The Modern Firm" by John Roberts and all articles and poetries by Charles Simic.
