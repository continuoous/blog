Thing about early spring sun is that he's gentler compared to his summer sibling. Case in point - Today is early spring and I didn't run for cover under shade. As I sat on my porch, I stared straight at him with eyes closed and received his warm red glow.

I suspect that tt wasn't just me. Birds were in an especially festive mood today. I think a celebrity was visiting them. Rubber tires rumbled along asphalt reminding me of the giant who snores deep underground – I’ve never seen him though.

I lost myself for a few minutes – taking in the warmth, listening to festivities, feeling the continuous rumble – not a worry in my mind.

Few minutes later, which felt like pleasant few hours, my eyes opened to what appeared to be an alien world awash in tinted blue. Gradually, this world returned to familiarity as my red cone cells begun firing again.

What is the meaning of these fleeting moments? I wondered, as we all do, if life had accrued meaning in these few minutes or if I squandered away precious time doing nothing, contemplating nothing – achieving nothing.

If I suppose that solitude on a porch under sun accounts for a worthwhile afternoon - does it make me a man of simple mind? Shouldn’t I have forgone this trivial Joy to forge success, nurture ambition and cultivate alliances?

I pondered some more and realized, as horror slowly seethed, that the joy of solitude on a porch under a gentle sun isn’t afforded to nearly as many people as it must be. It isn’t nearly as trivial as it ought to be.

Not far from where I live, evil ambition has driven millions away from their porches, balconies and homes. Mid-afternoon nap anywhere but in an underground bunker is, for many, an invitation to violent death. The continuous rumble isn’t an imaginary giant sleeping underground, but unrelenting fear growling the skies.

Life felt, at once, fortuitous and cruel. These fleeting moments, when paid close attention to, unearth joyous treasure troves. But, those are unearthed with cruel indifference to suffering within close proximity of those joys.

So - again, what is the meaning of these fleeting moments? It's freedom. Freedom is no trivial joy for it isn’t nearly universal as it should be. 

I wished all humans an afternoon nap on their porch under a gentle early spring sun unaccompanied by any worries for few precious moments.
