Spreadsheets are an excellent learning canvas to get under the hood and to build intuition for data science algorithms.
Few domains in our professional lives remain unaffected by machine learning. Businesses have thrived by integrating data science into operational strategy. Others have lost ground to competitors for ignoring latest advances.

Most times I unlock my phone - beyond consuming online services, unbeknownst to me, I’m also interacting with several machine learning algorithms vying, at the same time, to nudge my attention and my choices.

It’s not to say that my aim or yours should be to become a data science engineer overnight. However, good understanding of data science is a matter of remaining relevant at workplace. It’s also to be aware of how our choices are influenced by machines.

On one extreme, the dreadful god forsaken year that 2020 was, showed us getting data analytics right can be a matter of life and death. On the other end of the spectrum, novel applications of data science might tickle a brain curious not only about how it all works but also about why it works at all and when might it all go wrong.

## But why spreadsheets? Familiarity is why.

Right at the outset, if you want to, with your own bare hands – code a machine learning solution and scale it up for use by thousands of users, then ignore spreadsheets.

But if you have invested the past decade or more perfecting spreadsheet skill, then it is your unparalleled learning platform. Unlike with a new programming language, you aren’t trying to figure how to calculate a square root in spreadsheets. You only focus on learning the science with a tool that is your slave. Not the other way round.

Despite all its shortcomings, spreadsheets are the most ubiquitous and familiar analytics platform. It doesn’t hurt that excel is a very visual analytics tool needing very little or no code. Through tedious formulas and admittedly inefficient implementations, Excel will lay bare not only how an algorithm functions, but also which parameters affect performance and when things don’t work. It’s the perfect DIY platform to get your hands dirty.

## What if I’ll never need to write a line of code?

It is common knowledge among experts that most machine learning products have little or nothing to do with machine learning; products labeled “AI enabled” is often an unreasonable exaggeration if not simply a deception. That trend isn’t a coincidence in a world where Investors, Business executives and users have little or no hands-on understanding of data science beyond a crude and misplaced assumption that machine learning and artificial intelligence is akin to a black-box solution. In its worst form, machine learning projects become an expedition of spending millions of dollars only to build a product which reinforces management’s biases and instincts.

As a practical matter, understanding the mechanics of data science could mean you avoid wasting time and resources on projects to solve problems which haven’t been conquered by the most cutting-edge data science models. 

It could also mean unlocking opportunities to solve problems previously considered unsolvable. But most importantly, it could mean you separate problems needing Machine Learning from those which can be solved with rudimentary business rule tables.

I want to explore data science and machine learning on a spreadsheet canvas for the same reason I like  DIY projects. It’s fun!
