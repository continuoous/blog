    <h3>Thank you for stopping by</h3>

    <p>Continuoous is an obscure corner of world wide web unencumbered by likes, follows, ads and comments.
        I created this space to escape the everyday hustle of work & life.
        <br></br>
        If you've gotten here on your own, you probably are a surfer who likes to go off the beaten track into remote, difficult to reach, ip addresses.
        I hope youâ€™ll enjoy the solitude amidst a handful of words sprinkled around to occupy this pristine white space with half-formed thoughts.
