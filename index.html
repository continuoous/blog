    <p>Thank you for stopping by</p>

    <p>Continuoous is an obscure corner of the world wide web unencumbered by likes, follows, ads and comments.
        I created this space to escape the everyday hustle of work & life.

        If you've gotten here on your own, you probably are a surfer who likes to go off the beaten track into remote, difficult to reach, ip addresses.
        I hope youâ€™ll enjoy the solitude amidst a handful of words sprinkled here to occupy this pristine white space with half-formed thoughts.
